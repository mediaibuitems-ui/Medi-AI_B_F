# Doctor Dashboard — Complete Technical Reference

> **Source Files**: `lib/app/modules/doctor/` and `Medi_AI_Backend_railway/Backend-APIs/Controllers/DoctorsController.cs`

---

## 1. Module Overview

The Doctor Dashboard is the clinical management interface for BUITEMS clinic doctors. It provides tools for managing today's appointments, viewing patient records, writing prescriptions, managing their weekly schedule, setting booking preferences, and logging leave periods.

**State Management**: GetX (`GetView<DoctorDashboardController>`)
**Main Entry Route**: `/doctor-dashboard`
**Controller Location**: `lib/app/modules/doctor/dashboard/doctor_dashboard_controller.dart`
**Service Layer**: `lib/app/services/doctor_service.dart` (dedicated service — unlike student which uses ApiService directly)

## 4. Screen-by-Screen UI Breakdown

### 4.1 Doctor Dashboard Screen
**File**: `dashboard/doctor_dashboard_screen.dart`

#### AppBar
- Leading: Hamburger menu → Drawer
- Title: "Doctor Dashboard"
- Action: `Badge` notification icon with `unreadNotifications.length` count → `/notifications`

#### Body Sections

1. **Welcome Card** — Shows "Dr. {name}" + department + specialization. Gradient banner.
2. **Statistics Grid** — 3 tappable cards:
   - "Total Today" (`totalPatientsToday`) — tapping clears filter (show all)
   - "Pending" (`pendingToday`) — tapping sets `activeFilter = 'pending'`
   - "Completed" (`completedToday`) — tapping sets `activeFilter = 'completed'`
3. **Quick Actions** — 5 buttons in a `Wrap`: Today's Appointments, Patients, Schedule, Leaves, Booking Settings.
4. **Today's Appointments** — filterable list. Each card shows:
   - Patient name, time slot, status chip
   - **Action buttons** based on status:
     - `Pending` → "Confirm" button → `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/status` with `Status="Confirmed"`
     - `Confirmed` → "Mark Checked" button → `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/status` with `Status="Checked"`
     - "Write Prescription" button → navigates to `WritePrescriptionScreen` with `{ patientName, appointmentId }`
     - "View Patient" button → navigates to `PatientDetailScreen` with full patient args
5. **Upcoming Appointments** — max 2 items, same card style.

#### Controller State (DoctorDashboardController)

| Observable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `currentUser` | `Rx<User?>` | From `AuthService.getCurrentUser()` |
| `_allTodayAppointments` | `RxList<Appointment>` | All appointments for today |
| `todayAppointments` | `List<Appointment>` (computed) | Filtered by `activeFilter` value |
| `upcomingAppointments` | `RxList<Appointment>` | Future appointments |
| `activeFilter` | `RxString` | `''`=all, `'pending'`=pending+confirmed, `'completed'`=completed+checked |
| `isLoading` | `RxBool` | Dashboard load state |
| `totalPatientsToday` | `RxInt` | `_allTodayAppointments.length` |
| `completedToday` | `RxInt` | Filtered count |
| `pendingToday` | `RxInt` | Filtered count |
| `unreadNotifications` | `RxList<Map>` | Raw notification objects |

**Polling**: `_startNotificationPolling()` creates a `Timer.periodic` at 30-second intervals that:
1. Calls `_checkForNewAppointments()` — scans for appointments created after `_lastCheckTime`
2. Calls `_loadUnreadNotifications(showPopups: true)` — fetches notifications and shows local push if new

**Event subscription**: Listens to `AppointmentEventService` stream. On any appointment event → immediately refreshes `loadUpcomingAppointments()` and `loadTodayAppointments()`.

**Auto-create doctor profile** (`EnsureDoctorProfileExists`):
When a user with `Role="Doctor"` first accesses any DoctorsController endpoint, if no row exists in `doctors` table for their `userId`, the backend automatically creates a default profile row:
```csharp
doctor = new Doctor {
    Specialization = "General Physician",
    LicenseNumber = $"TEMP-{user.Id}-{DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks}",
    Qualification = "MBBS",
    Experience = 5,
    IsAvailable = true,
    ...
};
```

### 4.2 Patient Detail Screen
**File**: `patient_detail/patient_detail_screen.dart` (495 lines)

Opened by passing a Map of patient data via `Get.arguments`. StatelessWidget.

| Section | Fields Shown |
|---|---|
| Patient Header | CircleAvatar (initial letter), name (bold), subtitle (CMS number + department) |
| Personal Information | CMS Number, Exact Age (calculated from DOB), Gender, Date of Birth, Phone, Email |
| Medical History | `FutureBuilder` → `GET /api/MedicalHistory/patient/{id}` — shows conditions list or "No records" |
| Emergency Contacts | `FutureBuilder` → `GET /api/EmergencyContacts/user/{id}` — shows contacts list or "No contacts" |
| Action Buttons | "Write Prescription" (outlined, primary), "View Appointments" (outlined) |

Age is calculated precisely using year/month/day arithmetic, not just birth year subtraction.

### 4.3 Booking Settings Screen
**File**: `booking_settings/booking_settings_screen.dart` (381 lines)

#### AppBar
- "Appointment Booking Settings"
- No actions

#### Sections

**Section 1 — Appointment Configuration** (`Icons.calendar_today`):
- `Slider` (15–60, divisions: 9): Appointment Duration in minutes
- `Slider` (1–50): Max Patients Per Day
- `SwitchListTile`: Auto Confirm Appointments — if enabled, all new appointments are Confirmed regardless of role

**Section 2 — Break Time Configuration** (`Icons.lunch_dining`):
- `SwitchListTile`: Enable Break Time
- If enabled: two time picker rows — Break Start Time, Break End Time

**Section 3 — Reminder & Notification Settings** (`Icons.notifications`):
- `SwitchListTile`: Enable Appointment Reminders
- `Slider` (5–120 min, divisions: 23): Reminder Notification Time (minutes before appointment)

**Save Button**: Full-width `ElevatedButton` → `controller.saveSettings()` → `PUT /api/doctors/my-booking-settings`

**Storage**: Settings are serialized to JSON and stored in the `systemsettings` table with key `DoctorBookingSettings:{doctorId}`. Example value:
```json
{"appointmentDuration":30,"maxPatientsPerDay":20,"autoConfirmAppointments":false,"enableBreakTime":true,"breakStartTime":"12:00","breakEndTime":"13:00","enableAppointmentReminders":true,"reminderNotificationMinutes":30}
```

### 4.4 Write Prescription Screen
**File**: `write_prescription/write_prescription_screen.dart` (396 lines)

StatefulWidget (not GetX). Opens with `Get.arguments = { patientName, appointmentId }`.

#### AppBar
- Leading: BUITEMS logo image (falls back to back arrow if image fails)

   - Dosage (TextFormField)
   - Frequency dropdown (Once/Twice/Thrice daily)
   - Duration (TextFormField)
   - Instructions (TextFormField)
   - Delete row button (`Icons.remove_circle`)
5. **"Add Medication" Button** — `TextButton.icon` with `Icons.add` → adds blank row to `_medications` list
6. **Submit Button** — `ElevatedButton`: "Save Prescription" → calls `DoctorService.writePrescription()` → `POST /api/Prescriptions`

### 4.5 Schedule Screen
**File**: `schedule/`

Shows Mon–Sun day cards. Each day:

`POST /api/doctors/leaves` to add. `DELETE /api/doctors/leaves/{id}` to remove.

### 4.7 Patients Screen
**File**: `patients/`

List of unique patients who have had appointments with the doctor. Each card:
- Avatar (initial letter)
- Patient name
- Role (Student/Faculty)
- Last visit date

Tap → navigates to `PatientDetailScreen` with full patient args.

## 7. Recent Updates

| # | Update | File | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AI Symptom Analyzer integrated | Doctor dashboard | Doctors can now use the diagnostic tool directly from their sidebar. |
| 2 | Delete appointment support | Doctor dashboard | Doctors can now permanently delete past, cancelled, or completed appointments. |

> **Resolved Backlogs:** The following critical issues have been fixed:
> 1. **Booking Settings Validation:** Added strict schema validation and safe fallbacks for `DoctorBookingSettings` JSON storage.
> 2. **Fake Doctor Profiles:** Removed the dangerous auto-creation of doctor profiles with fake "TEMP" credentials; unassigned doctors now receive a strict 403 Forbidden.
> 3. **GetX Refactor:** `WritePrescriptionScreen` was refactored into a proper GetX architecture, fixing state-loss bugs on navigation pop (`PopScope`).
> 4. **Polling Optimization:** The heavy 30-second manual polling in `DoctorDashboardController` was eliminated and centralized correctly.
